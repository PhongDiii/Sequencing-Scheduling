# Sequencing-Scheduling
In this course, I have learned about : 
* How to shedule the job Shop problem with single and multiple machine with minimize Cmax, identify the ES,EC,LS and LC, control Slack.
* How to transfer condition to constraint using BigM
* How to perform a mathematical model from a problem description
* How to use CPLEX Solver to solve problem
* How to evaluate the error, fix bug and improve the system.

**Update**
* For some problem, I will preform code in fully description
* Create a file docx contain all my mathematical model for various problems in SCM
